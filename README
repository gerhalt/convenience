Added a basic .vimrc file, using the wombat theme and setting up some handy defaults.  My plan is to take this base

order to use themes.  Other than that, it's basic.

Currently, the focus is on basic server configuration.  I've taken and uploaded my rtorrent configuration, as well as the bash script used to ensure rtorrent is active and running in a tmux session that isn't currently attached to.
